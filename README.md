Analyze the following HTTP headers to determine:
1. The purpose of the HTTP call (e.g., data upload, API request, authentication, etc.).
2. Any sensitive data (e.g., API keys, tokens, PII) present in the headers.
3. The associated domains or IPs and their potential security risk.
4. Whether the headers indicate abnormal or suspicious activity.
Provide a structured summary explaining the significance of these headers from a data loss and security perspective.

HTTP Headers:
{headers_content}


Summarize the following main content with a focus on data loss risks:
1. What kind of data is being processed or transmitted?
2. Are there sensitive elements such as personal information, credentials, or intellectual property?
3. Identify any security risks, such as leaked access keys, passwords, or confidential business data.
4. Extract and structure the summary into distinct bullet points for easy review.

Content:
{formatted_json}


Combine the analysis of HTTP headers and content to provide a **final cybersecurity summary**:
1. What is the intent of the HTTP transaction based on both headers and content?
2. Are there indications of **data leakage, unauthorized access, or suspicious transmission**?
3. List key indicators from both header analysis and content analysis.
4. Provide **recommended actions** for a security analyst reviewing this case.

### Metadata Analysis:
{first_header_analysis}

### Content Analysis:
{json_keys_analysis}

Provide a structured, high-level summary focused on potential cybersecurity risks and data loss indicators.
